# FromGitLabToGitHub
A shell script made to easily import your GitLab repositories to GitHub but also to update them.

I initially made it because one of my teammates needs to use both GitLab and GitHub for a huge project known as Cellulam.
It may not be optimized but I wrote it really quickly and it works fine.

Just follow the instructions, it's that simple !
